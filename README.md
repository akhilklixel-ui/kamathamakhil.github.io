# Kamathamakhil — Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This repository contains the static website for **Kamathamakhil**.
Deploy to GitHub Pages by pushing the contents to a repository named `kamathamakhil.github.io`.

Steps:
1. Extract the ZIP and copy files into your repo folder or replace existing files.
2. Commit & push to `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Deploy portfolio"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Go to GitHub > Settings > Pages and ensure the site is published (branch: `main`, folder: `/`).
4. Wait a few minutes — your site should be available at `https://kamathamakhil.github.io`.

Contact form uses Formspree endpoint already configured to `https://formspree.io/f/mldoynog`.
